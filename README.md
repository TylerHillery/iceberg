# Overview

Iceberg playground repo

## Setup

Each directory holds a self contained example of interacting with Iceberg in various. I have use [RUNME](https://runme.dev/) notebooks to turn each project's README.md file interactive.

The python examples use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package and environment management.

There is a `.env.example` that you can copy to `.env` in which the RUNME will automatically read, otherwise it will prompt you for input.

```sh
cp -n .env.example .env
```
