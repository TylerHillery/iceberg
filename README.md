# Overview
Iceberg playground repo

## Setup

Each directory contains a self-contained example of interacting with Iceberg in various ways. I use [RUNME](https://runme.dev/) notebooks to make each project's `README.md` file interactive.

The Python examples use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package and environment management.

There is a `.env.example` file that you can copy to `.env`. RUNME will automatically read this file; otherwise, it will prompt you for input.

```sh
cp -n .env.example .env
```
