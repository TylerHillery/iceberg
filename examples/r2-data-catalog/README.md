# Instructions

This example shows how to connect and interact with the [R2 Data Catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/) with PyIceberg and DuckDBk.

The sample data uses data directly from my [PyPack Trends](https://github.com/TylerHillery/pypacktrends) project which isn't publicly accessible.
